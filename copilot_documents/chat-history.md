### Initial Requirements Discussion
- User requested creation of a Python script to process quiz data from Excel
- Script should:
  - Read student data from "Team Analysis" sheet
  - Process team and student information
  - Calculate scores per question
  - Generate output Excel with adjusted scores

### Setup (2:35 PM)
- Created Python virtual environment
- Installed required packages: pandas and openpyxl

### Clarifications (2:45 PM)
1. Score Adjustment:
   - Use rule of three for proportional adjustment
   - Example: if raw scores sum to 50 and total should be 100, multiply by 2

2. Question Column Format:
   - Columns follow pattern like "1_time", "1_score" for each question
   - Number before underscore indicates question number

3. Output Requirements:
   - Show both raw and adjusted scores for individual questions
   - Show both raw and adjusted total scores for teams

### Implementation Changes (3:00 PM)
- Updated script to use console input instead of command line arguments
- Added user-friendly interface with:
  - Input validation
  - Error handling
  - Progress messages
  - Clear instructions for users

### Implementation Changes (3:15 PM)
- Modified quiz value calculation approach:
  - Changed to ask for points per question instead of total points
  - Total quiz value is now calculated automatically (points per question Ã— number of questions)
  - Added more informative output showing question count and total points
  - Updated score adjustment logic to use per-question value directly

### Implementation Changes (3:30 PM)
- Removed team average calculations per user request
- Simplified output to include:
  - Team raw and adjusted totals
  - Individual student scores (raw and adjusted)
  - Individual question scores (raw and adjusted)

### Implementation Changes (3:45 PM)
- Fixed team score calculation logic:
  - Team scores now correctly reflect that the quiz is taken as a team
  - All students in a team now show the same scores
  - Using first student's scores as the team scores since all team members share the same score
  - Team totals and student totals are now consistent

### Implementation Changes (4:00 PM)
- Fixed raw total calculation logic:
  - Changed student raw total to use sum of question scores
  - Adjusted scores now correctly calculated by summing adjusted question scores
  - Maintained consistent team score application across team members

### Implementation Changes (4:30 PM)
- Redesigned score adjustment calculation:
  - Switched to using rule of three for all adjustments
  - User now inputs total quiz points directly
  - Raw scores are proportionally adjusted to match total points
  - Individual question scores and totals use consistent scaling
  - Added more detailed console output about scoring

### Implementation Changes (5:00 PM)
- Modified quiz score calculation:
  - Added user input for raw score per question
  - Updated score calculations to use actual raw scores
  - Example: if raw_score_per_question is 5, a perfect answer gets 5 raw points
  - Raw totals now correctly reflect actual raw scores (not just 0-1)
  - Adjusted scores still use rule of three to scale to total points

### Repository Setup (5:45 PM)
- Created feature branch 'feature/quiz-processing'
- Pushed all changes to remote repository
- Prepared for pull request creation
  - README.md with project documentation
  - requirements.txt with dependencies
  - PR template for standardization

### Implementation Changes (6:00 PM)
- Refactored codebase into modular structure:
  - Separated Excel processing into quiz_processor.py
  - Moved user interaction to user_interface.py
  - Created main.py as orchestrator
  - Improved code organization and maintainability
  - Added comprehensive documentation

### Implementation Changes (6:15 PM)
- Added input confirmation and modification system:
  - Users can now review all inputs before processing
  - Added ability to modify any input value
  - Improved user interface with numbered options
  - Process starts only after user confirms all values

### Implementation Changes (6:45 PM)
- Modified team name display in output Excel:
  - Team name now appears only on first student row
  - Empty string for subsequent team members
  - Improved output readability by reducing repetition
  - Maintained all score and student information

### Implementation Changes (7:00 PM)
- Enhanced Excel output format:
  - Modified team totals display to show only on first row
  - Team Raw Total and Team Adjusted Total now appear once per team
  - Improved readability by removing redundant information
  - Maintained all student and question score information
