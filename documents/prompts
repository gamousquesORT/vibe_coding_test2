I want to create a python script, using a virtual environment

--
a big prompt
On the inputdata folder there is an Excel file which contains in the "Team Analysis" sheet, the information form students that took a quizz.

Each student belong to the team which name is in the value of the "Team" column.

The student data which I need is in columns "StudentName", "Email Address" and "Student ID"

I want to request from the user, the name of the Quizz and the itÂ´s total points

For each Team, and for each student on the Team, and for each question I need the following data:
the question number. you could find it on the digits preceding the "_" on the columns names.
the score of each student

After processing the input data I want as output and excel file on the outputdata folder named as the quiz.
this file should have the following columns
the "Team Name"
the "Team Total score" adjusted to the total value of the points the user inputed
for each student in the team:
a column with the "Student ID"
a column with the "Student Name"
a column with the "Email Address"

For each question the team answered the score and the adjusted question score based on the quizz value the user inputed and the number of qaestions

if you have any question about the processing logic ask me

Now that I have set up the virtual environment and installed the necessary packages (pandas and openpyxl), I'll create the Python script. Before I proceed with the implementation, I need to clarify a few points about the requirements:

For the quiz score adjustment:

When you say "adjusted to the total value of the points the user inputed", should this be a proportional adjustment? For example, if the raw scores sum up to 50 but the quiz total should be 100, would we multiply each score by 2?
About the questions:

You mentioned extracting question numbers from column names preceding "_". Could you confirm if the column names in the Excel file follow a pattern like "1_QuestionText", "2_QuestionText", etc.?
For the output:

Should the individual question scores be shown as raw scores, adjusted scores, or both?
Do you want the team total score to be shown as both raw and adjusted, or just the adjusted score?
Could you please clarify these points so I can implement the solution accurately?

In the meantime, I'll start by creating a log entry of our chat in the specified files.

Yes, just use a rule of three to compute the value

About the questions:

You mentioned extracting question numbers from column names preceding "". Could you confirm if the column names in the Excel file follow a pattern like "1_QuestionText", "2_QuestionText", etc.?
No the columns have the data of each question as columns. ej. for question 1 it has columns with names "1_time", "1_score", and so on. the "1" ith the number of the question

For the output:

Should the individual question scores be shown as raw scores, adjusted scores, or both?
I want both

Do you want the team total score to be shown as both raw and adjusted, or just the adjusted score?
I want Both

change the script to request the input from the user using the console
---
the script was wrongly computing the scores. 
to compute the quizz total value i want to ask the user the vale of a question. asume all questions are valued the same.
By multiplying the number of questions by the question you can get the total value of the quizz.
the with total point the user inputs I wanto to compute, using a rule of the the adjusted values
---

I dont want the team average

---

it look that the Team Raw Total and Team Adusted Total are not computed correctly. the are not the sum of the scores of the students, they should be the same as the students. the team is composed of students and the quizz is taken by the students as a team
---
the adjusted Team total and student total are wrong. you need to find and use the max raw total of the quizz and then use the value inputed by the user to adjust
---

you are asumming that the raw score of each question is 1. you should ask the user for the raw socre of the questions and asume all the question have the same raw score
---

you need to distinguish the total raw score of a question from the score the student earned. then you need to adjust the score using the total raw scrore and the earned value which is the one you are reading form the orginal sheet

----
no, you are confused. the earned value for a question it is the score the student earned and is the value of the question score on the original sheet

--- first version ok ---
refactor the script so the user interaction code and the excel processing code are in different source code files

commit changes
