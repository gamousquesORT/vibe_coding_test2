user_interface.py:187

The call to cls.confirm_inputs is passing extra parameters that do not match its defined signature. Please remove the additional 'confirmed, should_exit =' portion so that only quiz_name, raw_score, and total_points are passed.

--
A ScoreEditor class is defined here while an almost identical implementation exists in ui/score_editor.py. To avoid duplication and potential maintenance issues, remove the redundant definition from user_interface.py.
