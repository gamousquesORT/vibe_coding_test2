This is a second [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) experiment. It involves using a coding LLM / AI agent to develop an app by giving instructions about what we want it to build, allowing the agent to code, access the terminal, execute corrective actions, among other things, in order to build the app. In this project, I used the VS Code extension [GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode).

The problem to solve involves grouping and converting the scores of students who took a multiple-choice test with several attempts. There is an Excel spreadsheet containing information about the students and the team they belong to. Each question is worth 5 points, and points are deducted based on the number of attempts:

First attempt, the question is worth 5 points

Second attempt, the question is worth 3 points

Third attempt, the question is worth 1 point

Finally, it is necessary to map the teamâ€™s total score to the actual score value of the test.
